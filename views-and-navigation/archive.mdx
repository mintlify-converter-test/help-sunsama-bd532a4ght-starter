## Purpose

Prevent your task list from getting cluttered with stale tasks that keep rolling over.

## Walkthrough

## How to use

### Introduction · 0:00

The archive is enabled by default. Once a task has rolled over more than four consecutive days, it will be automatically moved from today's task list to the archive.

When tasks roll into the archive, it's a good time to consider why they ended up there and remedy it. Tasks typically show up in the archive because:

1.  They're not actually that important
2.  Your day has more tasks than you can reasonably accomplish and there's no room for it
3.  You are procrastinating it 😏

### Accessing the archive · 0:31

There are three ways you can access the archive:

*   Click the "moon icon" in the right hand panel
*   Use the [keyboard shortcuts](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts)
     `Shift + A`
*   Use the [command palette](/docs/command-palette)
    

### Changing your archive setting · 0:53

*   You can disable auto-archiving by clicking the toggle switch at the top of the archive panel
*   You can change when things move into the archive by clicking the "N consecutive days" dropdown at the top of the archive panel.

### Triaging your archive · 1:50

*   If the task isn't actually important: Delete it or move it to the [backlog](/docs/backlog)
    
*   If it's important but you are procrastinating on it: Add a time estimate, add it to a specific day, and block off time to work on it.

## Best practices

*   If you're not sure where a task went, check your archive. You'll see a badge next to the archive icon whenever a new task is archived.
*   If you notice important tasks are getting archived, consider expanding the archive threshold from four days or disabling auto-archive entirely.
*   Consider creating a recurring task called "Review Archive" to remind you to check your archive so you don't lose sight of tasks that end up there.
